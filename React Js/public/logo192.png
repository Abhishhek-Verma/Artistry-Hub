<!-- This is a placeholder comment. For a real implementation, you would generate actual PNG files.
Since I cannot create binary PNG files, you'll need to:
1. Use an online tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Or use an image editor to convert favicon.svg to PNG at 192x192 pixels
3. Save it as logo192.png in the public folder -->
